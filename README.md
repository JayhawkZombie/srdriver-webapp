# How it works


This connects to the arduino using a UUID, and sometimes you may need to attempt to connect using a broader search as the name SRDriver does not always appear in the device list - it may appear as "Arduino".

Make sure your esp32 (or similar Arduino BLE device) is powered on, then load the page.
